## React Native App

To run your app on iOS:

```bash
cd /Users/cikai/Projects/ReactNative
react-native run-ios
```

or Open ios/ReactNative.xcodeproj in Xcode, Hit the Run button

To run your app on Android:

```bash
cd /Users/cikai/Projects/ReactNative
```

Have an Android emulator running (quickest way to get started), or a device connected

```bash
react-native run-android
```
